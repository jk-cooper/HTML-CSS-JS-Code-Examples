# HTML-CSS-JS-Example-Code

This is a sample website I am currently working on to polish my HTML/CSS and Javascript skills, it is an ongoing project and a work in progress. The site utilizes several methods of functionality including a rotating banner and linking to Google maps. My goal with this project is to have at least a working knowledge of the front-end and understand it so that I can contribute if needed on both sides of the development process.
